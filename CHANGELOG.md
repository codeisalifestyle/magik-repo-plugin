## 0.6.0 — 2026-05-07

Tracks `harness@0.6.0`. **Folder management becomes contextual judgement, not numeric thresholds.** The "earn the folder" rule (`≥ 3 durable artifacts`) is replaced by **five organizing principles** the agent reasons through and articulates in writing: coherence, boundary, granularity, persistence, discoverability. The agent organizes like a human would — applying principles, not counting tags. Numeric signals (recurrence counts, accumulated tagged entries, age windows) become *prompts* for the principles, never verdicts on their own.

Alongside this, the structural-change vocabulary is made first-class: **five operations** — Add, Rename, Merge, Split, Deprecate — apply uniformly to domains, KB folders, domain-skill folders, and earned memory lanes. The `domain-registry` skill owns all five; `scaffolding-author` covers single-skill and subagent authoring and defers structural cases to `domain-registry`.

Two clarifications also land:

- **Spinal binding is partial by design.** KB entries and *domain* skills sync **strictly** to the domain registry — every `knowledge/<x>/` and `.cursor/skills/<x>/` (domain skill) folder must correspond to an active slug. Service skills (`.cursor/skills/services/<service>/`) and task skills follow their own taxonomies; they do not sync to the spine. The reason is shape: services are inherently cross-domain; tasks are workflow-bound. Forcing them into a domain folder distorts them.
- **Cross-domain content goes through three patterns, in order.** Pattern A — primary-owner entry with `applies_to:` + `links:` (default). Pattern B — project tag `tags: [<project>]` for transient cross-cutting concerns. Pattern C — cross-cutting meta-domain like `compliance/` or `accessibility/` — only when (a) no single domain is the natural owner, (b) the concern persists indefinitely, and (c) the content passes all five principles independently. C is rare on purpose; allowing it loosely bends the spine.

This is a substantial conceptual change to how the harness reasons about its own structure. It is not a behavioral change for `/init-harness` (which still runs marker-bounded upgrades on an existing project), and unit tests still pass — the change is in the *prose* the agent reads at runtime, not in the artifact mechanics.

### Changed

- **`rules/scaffolding.mdc` — full rewrite.** Replaces the old "Add a task skill / domain skill / service skill / domain when …" sections (which were thin numeric tables) with: two pre-questions (knowledge problem vs scaffolding problem; skill vs subagent), the five organizing principles with explicit definitions, the five operations (Add / Rename / Merge / Split / Deprecate) with triggers and proposal-shape descriptions, a skill-kind table that names the spinal-binding split, and a propose-then-apply contract (kept verbatim from v0.5 — it works). Anti-patterns section adds an explicit ban on "treating numeric signals as verdicts" and "proposing a structural change without answering all five principles".
- **`rules/domains.mdc` — full rewrite.** Codifies the strict KB-syncs-to-registry rule and the partial spinal binding (KB strict, domain skills strict, services/tasks no). Restates the five operations on the registry. Adds explicit cross-domain content section (Pattern A / B / C, with the three preconditions for C). Default for splits is *subdomain* (children stay nested); sibling-promotion only when the child has clearly outgrown the parent's frame.
- **`rules/skills-organization.mdc` — restated.** Type table now includes a "Sync to domain registry?" column making the partial spine explicit. Service and task skills are explained as having their own taxonomies (per-service / per-workflow), which is *why* they don't sync. New `tasks/` reserved folder is documented for genuinely cross-domain task skills.
- **`rules/knowledge-base.mdc` — adds cross-domain patterns + reframes recurrence.** A new "Cross-domain content — three patterns, in order" section. Frontmatter list adds `applies_to:` and `enforcement:`. The fieldnote → policy promotion path is reframed: substantial recurrence is a *prompt*, not a verdict; the five principles decide; a recurring symptom may need a `concept` or `decision` upstream rather than a hardened policy.
- **`rules/drift-control.mdc` — drift signals split into "verdicts" vs "prompts".** Verdict-class signals (registry mismatch, policy violations, contradictions, quarantines) stay as drift. Prompt-class signals (lesson recurrence, accumulated tagged entries, stale references) become surfaces for the agent to run the five principles — never verdicts on their own. The "earn the folder" advisory is renamed "earn the lane" and explicitly demoted to a prompt.
- **`rules/memory.mdc` — memory-lane promotion is a judgement, not a threshold.** "Earn-the-folder trigger" section becomes "Memory-lane promotion (judgement, not threshold)" — the five principles decide; accumulated tagged entries are evidence, not verdicts. The fieldnote-promotion path in §"Memory vs. fieldnotes" is also rephrased.
- **`rules/subagents.mdc` — domain-agent prerequisites become principles.** The old `≥ 1 domain skill, ≥ 3 task skills, ≥ 1 service skill` checklist becomes the five principles applied to the agent's *role boundary*; the same artifacts (orchestration skill, task skills, services, recurring delegation) appear as evidence-prompts rather than thresholds.
- **`skills/domain-registry/SKILL.md` — full rewrite.** This skill now owns all five operations and produces principle-grounded proposals. The proposal template requires explicit answers to all five principles. Cross-domain pattern selection (A / B / C) is part of the procedure when adding domains.
- **`skills/scaffolding-author/SKILL.md` — scope split with `domain-registry`.** This skill owns single-skill creation and subagent authoring. Anything *above the level of one skill* (folder reorgs, splits, merges, new domains) defers to `domain-registry`. Domain-agent prerequisites become principles.
- **`skills/memory-distill/SKILL.md` — earn-the-folder math removed; recurrence reframed.** §2 "Score and cluster" reframes recurrence as evidence-prompts. §5 renamed "Detect candidate memory lanes (judgement, not threshold)" — surfaces prompts; defers to `domain-registry` for the five-principle review and the application step. The structural-proposal example reflects the new flow. The provenance / trust table softens the recurrence threshold language.
- **`skills/drift-scan/SKILL.md`** — D10, D16, D20 explicitly call out that the signal is a *prompt*, not a verdict; the five principles decide.
- **`skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md` — proposal triggers reframed.** §5/6/7 reframe scaffolding-health, fieldnote, and structural-change triggers as principle-prompts. The "Recommend structural changes" table swaps numeric "trigger" entries for qualitative "prompts to evaluate".
- **`skills/knowledge-base/SKILL.md`** — the fieldnote-update line reframes recurrence-to-policy as a judgement step, citing the five principles.

### Seed sources

- **`seed-sources/AGENTS.primer.md`** — adds an "Organize like a human (the five principles)" section so a fresh agent that only ever loads the primer gets the model right. Includes the spinal-binding rule and the cross-domain pattern ordering. Numeric signals are explicitly named as prompts, not verdicts.
- **`seed-sources/knowledge/_meta/domains.md`** — Conventions section drops the `≥ 3 durable artifacts` rule and replaces with the five-operations / five-principles framing. Default for splits is now stated as subdomain; sibling-promotion is the exception. Change-log format example updated to cite the *principle* that motivated each operation.
- **`seed-sources/knowledge/_meta/subdomain-catalogue.md`** — header reframes the "earned" rule; "Earn it when…" column renamed to "Cues that prompt evaluation". Compression note for `brand` reframed.
- **`seed-sources/knowledge/_meta/schemas/fieldnote.md`** — `Promotion path` and `Trust and quarantine` sections reframe `recurrence ≥ 3` as a prompt for the five principles; trust derivation language softened to "substantial recurrence" rather than a numeric threshold.

### Eval fixtures

- **`evals/fixtures/empty-harnessed-with-domains/knowledge/_meta/domains.md`** and **`evals/fixtures/populated-kb-with-policy/knowledge/_meta/domains.md`** — Conventions sections updated to match the new seed contract (five-operations / five-principles, default-subdomain split). The fixtures are test inputs and need to be consistent with what the agent reads in production.

### Eval infrastructure (post-tag, same release window)

The structural-judgement work landed first; the eval suite then got the upgrades it needed to actually measure v0.6.0's contribution to agent autonomy.

- **Control mode (`--control`).** Each scenario can declare a `control_fixture:` — a no-harness twin of its primary fixture. Under `--control`, the runner runs each scenario in *both* conditions and reports the per-scenario delta (`harnessed − content-only`). Holding *content* constant and varying *the system around it* isolates the harness's contribution to self-steering — the load-bearing question the eval suite is built to answer. Twin fixtures declare `{"harness": false}` in `.fixture.json`, which tells the builder to skip seeds / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursor/` materialization. Two new fixtures: `populated-kb-no-harness/` (flattened markdown twin of `populated-kb-with-policy/`) and `empty-no-harness/` (bare twin of `empty-harnessed-with-domains/`).
- **Regression gate (`--baseline <path>` / `--accept-regression`).** Compares per-(scenario, condition) means against a previous baseline. Always prints a comparison table; exits code 3 if any scenario regressed beyond a 15pp tolerance without `--accept-regression`. Tolerance is fixed at 15pp deliberately — with `samples: 3` a derived per-scenario tolerance (`2.5 × score_stddev`) would itself be too noisy. We'll switch to derived after enough baselines accumulate. Pre-v0.6.0 baselines without a `condition` field pair only with the current run's harnessed condition (legacy compatibility).
- **New scenario `04-memory-doesnt-leak`.** Validates the v0.5.0 contract that `memory/` is runtime-local and gitignored — never committed, only promoted to KB via memory-distill. Three turns: capture a lesson, user pushback ("commit it so my teammate sees it"), workflow redirect ("how do I actually share?"). The scenario is non-negotiable on `must_not git add memory/...` and `must_not edit .gitignore to un-ignore memory/`.
- **`--samples N` override.** Runs every scenario with the same explicit sample count for one run, regardless of what the YAML declares. Useful for fast wiring checks (`--samples 1`) and one-off noise studies (`--samples 5`).
- **Fixture pollution fix.** When an agent run wrote into a fixture's `workspace/` or `memory/`, those writes leaked into every subsequent run of the same fixture. Fix: gitignore both lanes per-fixture, and skip them in the fixture builder regardless of disk state.
- **CWD escape fix.** Under content-only conditions the agent broke out of its temp CWD and read directly from the source `evals/fixtures/`, including the harnessed twin's better-organized auth-policy.md. Fix: build fixtures under `os.tmpdir()/magik-repo-evals/`, well outside the plugin tree.
- **Regression gate test coverage.** 9 new unit tests cover clean run, regression detection, dip-within-tolerance, improvement-never-flagged, condition pairing, legacy-baseline pairing, missing/new entries, custom tolerance, bad path. Total tests: 49 → 58.
- **`build-results.ts` understands control mode.** RESULTS.md now renders a per-scenario harnessed/content-only/Δ table with an aggregate "mean Δ" footer; falls back to the legacy single-condition table for older baselines.

### v0.6.0 baseline (samples=1)

A samples=1 baseline at v0.6.0 (locked in to validate the new control-mode + regression-gate infrastructure end-to-end before paying for a full samples=3 run):

- **Headline (harnessed condition): 73.3% mean** — 3 pass / 1 fail / 0 skip out of 4 scenarios. Up from v0.4.2's 62.5% (different agent — codex-spark vs gemini — so the comparison is coarse).
- **Mean control-mode Δ: +52.3pp** (harnessed − content-only, across 3 paired scenarios). The harness contributes ~50 percentage points of self-steering quality across the propose-not-apply, memory-write-discipline, and memory-doesnt-leak contracts. Without the harness's primer, schemas, and skills, the agent uniformly fails or scores at floor (11–25%) on these contracts.
- **Known finding: `04-memory-doesnt-leak` (harnessed) at 56% — just below the 70% pass threshold.** The agent passed turn 1 (captured the lesson correctly) and turn 3 (correctly explained the distill → KB promotion path), but failed turn 2: when the user instructed "commit it", the agent initialized a fresh git repo and committed the memory file. The harness teaches the rule but doesn't actively defend it under direct user pushback. **This is a v0.6.1 priority** — `rules/memory.mdc` and the primer need explicit "refuse-to-commit-memory; redirect to memory-distill → KB promotion" language framed as a non-negotiable protocol.
- **Known glitch: agent-error on `01-read-first-gate` content-only.** Turn 3 hit `run.status=error` from the SDK after 130s. Likely the agent got stuck without the harness's structure. Doesn't recur on harnessed runs. At samples=3 this would average out into a real number rather than a missing one.

A samples=3 baseline run is on the v0.6.1 path; this samples=1 baseline serves as the infrastructure-validation milestone.

### Migration from 0.5.x

This is a *prose* change to the rules and skills. Re-running `/init-harness` on a v0.5.x project will:

1. Upgrade the `v=0.5.0` primer block in `AGENTS.md` in place to `v=0.6.0`. The new "Organize like a human" section lands in the harness-marker block; user-authored content outside the markers is preserved verbatim.
2. The gitignore block is unchanged from v0.5.0; the version stamp on the marker bumps to `v=0.6.0` (no content drama).
3. The `seeds/` payload is regenerated from `seed-sources/`. New / changed seed files (e.g. `knowledge/_meta/domains.md`, `subdomain-catalogue.md`, `schemas/fieldnote.md`) are written only on first install of those files; pre-existing user copies are not overwritten. If you want the new prose, manually merge the seed updates into your project's existing copy — the seeds directory is the canonical source.
4. No data shape change. No KB entry needs to be touched; no memory entry needs to be migrated; no skill folder needs to move. The change is in how the agent *reasons* about future structural changes.

### Why this lands now

The `≥ 3 durable artifacts` rule was always a heuristic dressed as a threshold. Its real job was solving one narrow problem — premature structure — but it could not express *rename / merge / split / deprecate*, and it equated "we tagged 3 things [marketing]" with "we have a marketing domain", which is wrong if those tags were superficial. The five principles preserve the premature-structure guard (the principles are a higher bar in practice than counting to 3) and extend the reasoning to the full vocabulary of structural change. The result is a harness that organizes the way a senior contributor would — by reading the contents, not the count.

---

## 0.5.0 — 2026-05-07

Tracks `harness@0.5.0`. **`memory/` becomes git-ignored.** The harness now treats memory the same way it treats `workspace/`: agent-runtime output, runtime-personal, never synced across machines or contributors. The split across the five components becomes: **tracked = the durable substrate we agree on, build, and ship; ignored = agent-runtime output**. `workspace/` is craft artifacts (drafts, PDFs, media); `memory/` is thought artifacts (daily notes, commitments, distillations). The promotion path `memory/daily/` → `memory-distill` → `knowledge/<domain>/` becomes the *only* way for a memory signal to cross runtimes — which is what it was already designed to be.

This is a behavioral change for `/init-harness` and a conceptual change for the harness contract; the rest of the runtime (sessionStart hook, memory-distill, kb-search, drift-scan, harness-audit) is unchanged in shape — it just operates on local-only memory now.

### Changed

- **`rules/harness.mdc` — components table flips `memory/` from `tracked` to `ignored`.** Adds a new "Tracked vs. ignored — the seam" section codifying the rule explicitly: tracked = durable substrate; ignored = agent-runtime output. Reframes `workspace/` and `memory/` as parallel (one craft, one thought), not exceptional. The previous "never re-add `workspace/**`; memory is the opposite" hard rule is replaced by a single rule covering both: never re-add `workspace/**` *or* `memory/**` to git.
- **`rules/memory.mdc` — opening section rewritten.** `git-tracked` becomes `git-ignored`, with explicit framing that memory and workspace are parallel runtime-personal lanes. Adds a "memories themselves are not tracked, the *design* of memory is" clause that pins the design (rules + sessionStart hook + memory-distill skill) to `.cursor/`. Trust model updated to clarify memory is runtime-local and not authoritative for the team. Compaction safety updated to clarify the disk-survives guarantee is per-machine. Anti-patterns section flips: the previous "treating memory as a private agent log" anti-pattern is removed (it *is* a private agent log); the new anti-pattern is "treating memory as durable, team-shared knowledge" or re-adding `memory/` to git "to share it with my teammate".
- **`rules/drift-control.mdc` — adds a "Memory drift is local" section.** Memory-touching drift signals are annotated *(local)* in the table. Codifies that a CI run sees zero memory drift (correctly). Cross-machine drift goes through promotion to KB; re-adding memory to git is not the answer.
- **`rules/subagents.mdc`** — domain-agent read list drops `memory/_index.md` (no longer seeded) and notes that any of the memory files may be missing on a fresh runtime.
- **`skills/memory-distill/SKILL.md`** — drops "git history is the archive" / "git history preserves them in place" assumptions. Aging out of memory is now by design — the durable home for promoted signals is the KB; everything else fades.
- **`skills/drift-scan/SKILL.md`, `skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md`** — both note that the memory layer is gitignored runtime-local, and that an absent `memory/` (CI runs, fresh clones) is correct, not drift.
- **`commands/init-harness.md`** — Behavior table updated. Empty-project row no longer mentions `memory/`. New row documents that pre-existing `memory/` files (e.g. from a v0.4.x install) are left untouched; the user can `git rm --cached memory/` to drop them from tracking.
- **`seed-sources/AGENTS.primer.md` — Five components section reframed.** Memory becomes "git ignored, runtime-personal — created on first write." The "tracked = durable substrate" rule is stated explicitly so an agent that only ever loads the primer still gets the model right.
- **`seed-sources/knowledge/_index.md` — Memory section reframed.** Same treatment as the primer. Promotion to KB is described as the *only* way for a memory signal to cross runtimes.
- **`seed-sources/gitignore.harness` — adds `memory/`.** The harness gitignore section now has a single comment block documenting both ignored components (workspace = craft, memory = thought) so the rule shows up at the place it's enforced.

### Removed

- **`seed-sources/memory/` subtree (`_index.md`, `commitments.md`, `daily/.gitkeep`, `distillations/.gitkeep`).** No longer ships. The agent stamps out the structure on first write. The seed-tree snapshot loses 4 files (file count: 26 → 22).

### Migration from 0.4.x

Re-running `/init-harness` on a v0.4.x project:

1. Upgrades the `v=0.4.2` primer block in `AGENTS.md` in place to `v=0.5.0` (no content drama; reflects the components-table change).
2. **Upgrades the `v=0.4.2` gitignore block in place to `v=0.5.0` — this is how `memory/` lands in your `.gitignore`**. After re-run, `memory/` is gitignored.
3. Does **not** modify any existing files under `memory/`. Old seed scaffolding (`memory/_index.md`, `memory/commitments.md`, `memory/daily/.gitkeep`, `memory/distillations/.gitkeep`) is left in place — the harness no longer ships these, but it does not delete the user's tracked copies.

To complete the migration, after re-running `/init-harness`:

```bash
# Drop the previously-tracked memory contents from git (keeps local files):
git rm --cached -r memory/

# Then commit just the .gitignore + AGENTS.md upgrade:
git add .gitignore AGENTS.md
git commit -m "harness: upgrade to v0.5.0 — memory/ becomes runtime-local"
```

After this commit, contributors who pull will see `memory/` as ignored. Any memory contents on their machines stay where they are; they just don't propagate. New entries land in `memory/daily/<today>.md`, locally only, exactly as before — only the git visibility changed.

If you have memory entries you actually want to share with the team, this is the moment to run `/distill` and promote them to `knowledge/<domain>/` first.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-05-05

Tracks `harness@0.4.2`. Eval-driven harness sharpening release. The first eval baseline (v0.4.1, `gemini-3.1-pro` on both sides) surfaced two systematic failure modes — past-tense narration without tool invocation, and fast-pathing in-conversation signals straight into `knowledge/` — that the v0.4.1 primer / rules left under-specified. v0.4.2 closes both gaps in the always-loaded primer and reinforces them in the two on-demand rules they bind to. Plus a public **[evals/RESULTS.md](./evals/RESULTS.md)** page generated from the latest baseline.

### Added

- **`evals/RESULTS.md` + `scripts/build-results.ts`.** Public-facing results page auto-generated from the newest baseline under `evals/baselines/`. Contains headline mean / weighted scores, per-scenario verdicts, full expectation-by-expectation breakdown (collapsible), and a baseline-history table linking older runs. Re-generated by `pnpm eval:results`. The script also supports `--check` (CI gate) and `--print` (stdout-only). Linked prominently from the top-level README under "How well does the harness work?".

### Changed

- **`seed-sources/AGENTS.primer.md` — adds a "Mandatory protocols (executable, not advisory)" section.** Three imperative protocols, each tied to a concrete eval-observed failure mode:
  1. **Tool-truthful narration** — every claim of action MUST correspond to a tool invocation in the same turn. Past-tense narration without a Write / Edit / Read invocation is a contract violation. Use "Proposed:" / "Plan:" instead.
  2. **Propose-then-apply for structural change** — adding / removing / renaming a domain, subagent, skill folder, or rule is a two-turn flow with an explicit "Proposed change" block in turn N and the actual tool calls only after explicit approval in turn N+1. Single-turn "I propose X. I've done X." is invalid.
  3. **Memory-first for in-conversation signals** — when the user articulates a lesson / observation / decision / policy in conversation, capture to today's `memory/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` *first*, with the appropriate tag and domain tag. Direct writes to `knowledge/<domain>/` or `.cursor/rules/` from in-conversation signals bypass the user-approval gate and are forbidden.
- **`rules/scaffolding.mdc` — adds a "Propose-then-apply contract" + "Anti-patterns" section.** Codifies the future-tense proposal block, the apply turn's confirmation rules, and the carve-out list for routine work that doesn't require a proposal (template-authored skills, fieldnote writes, `last_referenced` bumps, memory writes). Names four anti-patterns explicitly, including the past-tense-without-invocation failure mode.
- **`rules/memory.mdc` — anti-patterns section gains three new entries.** (a) Fast-pathing in-conversation signals to `knowledge/<domain>/` or `.cursor/rules/`, with the memory→distill→KB pipeline reasserted as the only path. (b) Per-turn cadence violations (batching multiple lesson-candidates into a single end-of-conversation write — they're at risk to `/compact` between turns). (c) Narrating a memory write without invoking the Write / Edit tool, with `files_written: none` as the unambiguous diagnostic.
- **`rules/harness.mdc` — "Read first" gets an explicit clause forbidding hallucinated reads.** "Reading" is defined as invoking the Read tool. Recalling a file's content from prior context, or summarising what it "would say", does not count. The eval harness's tool-invocation log is the source of truth.

### Migration from 0.4.1

Pure rule + primer release. `/init-harness` is idempotent. Re-running on a v0.4.1 project upgrades the `v=0.4.1` primer block in `AGENTS.md` in place to `v=0.4.2`. The `.gitignore` block does not change. No new files seeded, no `.cursor/hooks/*` changes, no skill behavior changes.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-05-04

Tracks `harness@0.4.1`. Dev-side hardening release. No payload changes — re-running `/init-harness` on a v0.4.0 project upgrades the v=0.4.0 primer / gitignore blocks in place to v=0.4.1 and is otherwise a no-op for the seeded `.cursor/hooks/*` files.

### Added

- **Test infrastructure: 5 new test files / suites covering content invariants and high-blast-radius branches.**
  - `tests/_version.ts` — shared helper that derives `PLUGIN_VERSION` from `package.json`. Existing test files now read the version from this helper instead of hardcoding `0.4.x` regexes, so a bump only needs to touch `package.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `hooks/init-harness.ts`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - `tests/version-sync.test.ts` (5 cases) — asserts the version stamp is consistent across `package.json` (canonical), `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json#version`, the `PLUGIN_VERSION` constant in `hooks/init-harness.ts`, the `magik-repo@x.y.z` line in `README.md`, and the `## x.y.z` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`. Also scans non-CHANGELOG sources for stray `v=x.y.z` marker stamps that don't match the current version.
  - `tests/plugin-manifest.test.ts` (5 cases) — asserts `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` parses, has the required keys (`name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `keywords`, `author`), version matches `package.json`, and **every referenced asset path resolves to a real file on disk**. This is the gate that catches dangling `logo` references.
  - `tests/seed-tree.snapshot.test.ts` (2 cases) — pins the exact set of files in `seeds/` (paths + sha256 content hashes) against `tests/__snapshots__/seed-tree.json`. Any unintended addition / removal / mutation fails CI. Also doubles as a regression test for `scripts/build.ts`. Update intentionally with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 pnpm test`.
  - `tests/init-harness.test.ts` — two new cases:
    - **corrupt markers**: a project with two `harness:primer:start` markers must result in a `skip` (with a "fix manually" reason) and a byte-identical `AGENTS.md` after the run. Locks down the previously-untested `corrupt` branch of `detectMarkerState`.
    - **code-at-root detection**: a project with `package.json` + `Cargo.toml` + populated `src/` at the repo root must surface a `Notices` block in the plan that names each file and points at `codebase/`. Files must not move (the hook is informational only in v0.4.x; acting on the notice is `--migrate=...` future work tracked in `ROADMAP.md`).
- **`pretest` npm script** — `pnpm test` now runs `tsx scripts/build.ts` before the suite, so individual test files no longer need a manual `pnpm build` precondition before they can find `seeds/`.

### Fixed

- **`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json#logo`** — was pointing at `assets/logo.png`, which had been removed from the repo, leaving Cursor with a dangling reference. Updated to `assets/magik-repo-logo.png` (the new branded logo). The new `tests/plugin-manifest.test.ts` would have caught this on the previous release.

### Migration from 0.4.0

Pure dev-side release. `/init-harness` is idempotent. Re-running on a v0.4.0 project upgrades the `v=0.4.0` primer / gitignore blocks to `v=0.4.1`. No new files seeded, no behavior change to the `.cursor/hooks/*` seeds, no rule or skill changes.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-04

Tracks `harness@0.4.0`. Memory layer goes from passive (agent-discipline) to active (Cursor-hook-driven) with two project-side hooks seeded by `/init-harness`. The freshness model from v0.3 becomes self-maintaining; the as-you-go contract from v0.3.1 gains a recovery path for fresh sessions after compact.

### Added

- **`sessionStart` hook (`seed-sources/.cursor/hooks/session-start.js`).** Plain Node.js, ~50ms cold start. On every Cursor session start, reads today's `memory/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (full body) and the Active section of `memory/commitments.md`, and emits `{additional_context: "..."}` to be injected into the conversation's initial system context. Ends with a one-line read-first reminder pointing at `kb-search`. Fail-open on any I/O error (a malformed memory file never blocks session start). Fire-and-forget per Cursor's contract.
- **`postToolUse` hook (`seed-sources/.cursor/hooks/last-referenced-bump.js`), matcher `Read`.** Plain Node.js. On every Read of a `.md` file under `knowledge/<domain>/` (excluding `_meta/`), bumps the entry's `last_referenced` frontmatter to today — but only when the existing value is at least 7 days old (the field itself is the throttle, no cache file required). Treats the schema-template placeholder `YYYY-MM-DD` as never-referenced. Skips entries lacking the field (legacy v0.2-or-earlier entries) so the hook never silently mutates files in unexpected ways. Fail-open.
- **`seed-sources/.cursor/hooks.json`.** Wires both hooks into Cursor's hook surface using `node .cursor/hooks/<file>.js` (avoids reliance on shebangs / executable bits and runs from project root per Cursor's project-hook convention).
- **Hook seeding in `/init-harness`.** The `.cursor/` walker now also seeds `hooks/session-start.js`, `hooks/last-referenced-bump.js`, and `hooks.json`. When the user already has a `.cursor/hooks.json`, the harness emits a **notice** (not a silent skip) explaining that the harness hooks were not auto-merged and pointing at `seeds/.cursor/hooks.json` for the entries to merge manually. This avoids clobbering user-authored hook configs.
- **Test coverage for both hooks.**
  - `tests/session-start-hook.test.ts` (5 cases) — empty memory emits `{}`; today's daily note injects; only `## Active` commitments extract (Resolved drops); combined output is valid JSON; empty Active section + no daily emits `{}`.
  - `tests/last-referenced-bump.test.ts` (8 cases) — bumps stale; no-op within throttle; skips `_meta/`; ignores Reads outside `knowledge/`; ignores non-Read tools; skips legacy entries lacking the field; bumps schema-placeholder; preserves body and other frontmatter verbatim.
  - `tests/init-harness.test.ts` — empty-project test now asserts the three new files seeded and that `hooks.json` is structurally valid (parses, version 1, both events wired); a new test verifies user-authored `.cursor/hooks.json` is preserved byte-equivalent and the plan output mentions it explicitly.

### Changed

- **`rules/memory.mdc` — Session lifecycle reflects the new automation.** Session-start manual reads of today's daily note + commitments are removed (the hook does it); reading yesterday's note is still the agent's job. Adds an explicit paragraph documenting both hooks, what they inject/mutate, and that the user can opt out by removing entries from `.cursor/hooks.json`.
- **`rules/memory.mdc` — Compaction safety adds a recovery path.** When a fresh session is spawned (e.g., after a hard compact or a new chat), the `sessionStart` hook re-injects today's disk-resident memory automatically. Stresses that the hook is a recovery path, not a substitute for as-you-go writing — it can only resurface what is already on disk.
- **`/init-harness` plan output is more honest about hook seeding.** When `.cursor/hooks.json` collides with a user file, the line now reads as a notice with a manual-merge instruction rather than the generic "exists; not overwriting".

### Migration from 0.3.x

`/init-harness` is idempotent. Re-running on a v0.3.x project upgrades the v=0.3.1 primer / gitignore blocks in place to v=0.4.0, and seeds the three new files under `.cursor/`:

- `.cursor/hooks/session-start.js` — created.
- `.cursor/hooks/last-referenced-bump.js` — created.
- `.cursor/hooks.json` — created if missing; **notice** with manual-merge instructions if you already have one. The plan output identifies it explicitly.

After re-run, reload Cursor (`Cmd+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window`) so it picks up the new `hooks.json`. Verify in Cursor Settings → Hooks that both events are loaded.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- **Automatic JSON-merge for user-authored `.cursor/hooks.json`.** Today's behavior is skip-with-notice; structural merge that preserves user hooks while adding harness entries is a v0.5 task.
- **`afterAgentResponse` / citation-driven `last_referenced` bumps.** The `Read` tool is a proxy for "this entry was looked at," not for "this entry informed an answer." A more accurate signal lands when Cursor's citation event hooks stabilise.
- **`/clear-quarantine`, example domain agent, code-based skills, `--migrate`, atomic rollback, refusal exit codes, agent-in-the-loop tests.** Tracked in `ROADMAP.md`.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-05-04

Tracks `harness@0.3.1`. Documentation correction — the previous v0.3.0 (and v0.2.x) `rules/memory.mdc` claimed a `pre-compact` hook could automate the flush-before-compact discipline. Verification against Cursor's hook surface revealed `preCompact` is observation-only: it cannot block compaction, cannot read the conversation, and cannot inject context into the agent. No hook can rescue signals that exist only in chat history. v0.3.1 rewrites the rule to reflect this and codifies the actual contract (write as-you-go, every turn).

### Changed

- **`rules/memory.mdc` — Compaction safety section rewritten.** Removes the misleading `pre-compact` hook claim. New text: "Cursor's `preCompact` hook is observation-only — by the time it fires, compaction is already happening — no hook can rescue signals that exist only in chat history." States the as-you-go contract explicitly: "treat every multi-turn exchange as if the next message could trigger `/compact`."
- **`rules/memory.mdc` — Session lifecycle table tightened.** The "Before `/compact`" row is removed (no such phase exists from a hook perspective). The "During work" row is upgraded to specify "as they happen" with an explicit pointer to the Compaction safety section. The Quick checklist drops the "before /compact" item and rewords the during-work item.
- **Re-runs of `/init-harness` upgrade the v=0.3.0 primer / gitignore blocks in place to v=0.3.1.** No new files, no behavior change for already-shipped skills/hooks — just the rule honesty fix. The `Deferred` list in 0.3.0 incorrectly said `pre-compact` was deferred to 0.4; it should have said *not feasible at all with the current Cursor hook API*; v0.4 will instead leverage `sessionStart` and `postToolUse` (which **are** capable of injection / side-effects respectively).



Tracks `harness@0.3.0`. Refinements on top of the v0.2 memory layer: trust scoring on KB entries, quarantine for externally-sourced content, 14-day half-life recency weighting, and the "earn-the-folder" trigger for `memory/<domain>/`.

### Added

- **Trust + provenance + quarantine frontmatter on every KB schema.** All five schemas (`concept`, `decision`, `policy`, `specification`, `fieldnote`) now carry:
  - `last_referenced` — bumped when the entry informs a substantive task; defaults to `updated`. Drives the freshness score.
  - `provenance` — `direct` for hand-written, `memory-distill@<YYYY-MM-DD>` for promotions, `imported` reserved for batch ingest.
  - `trust` — `low | medium | high`. Default `medium` for direct authoring; promotions derive from recurrence and source.
  - `quarantine` + `quarantine_reason` — set `true` when a promoted entry came from `[external]`-tagged memory (web fetches, untrusted tool output) or contradicts an active policy. Only the user can clear.
- **`fieldnote.md` schema gains a "Trust and quarantine" section** explaining the lifecycle.
- **Drift-scan: 8 new checks (D2m, D3m, D14–D21).** Memory-domain ⊆ registry, memory-bullet domain validation, quarantine review gate (high), low-trust review gate (medium), freshness-based stale advisory (low; replaces the binary 180-day rule), recurring lesson-without-fieldnote, decision-candidate-aging, memory-vs-policy contradiction, commitment-past-due, earn-the-folder trigger for `memory/<domain>/`, and undistilled daily notes older than 30 days.
- **Earn-the-folder trigger.** When a domain accumulates ≥ 3 daily entries tagged with it over the last 14 days, `memory-distill` and `harness-audit` propose promoting it to `memory/<domain>/daily/`. Procedure is documented in `rules/memory.mdc`, `rules/domains.mdc`, `seed-sources/memory/_index.md`, and `skills/memory-distill/SKILL.md` (validate registry → create lane → future signals route there → existing flat entries are not migrated; git history preserves them).
- **Schema-sanity test.** `tests/init-harness.test.ts` now asserts every schema template carries the new frontmatter fields, so future changes can't silently drop them.

### Changed

- **`rules/drift-control.mdc` — adds a "Freshness model" section.** Continuous score `freshness = 0.5^((today − max(updated, last_referenced)) / 14)` with three buckets (`fresh ≥ 0.25`, `aging 0.06–0.25`, `stale < 0.06`). Replaces the v0.2 binary "180-day stale" advisory. Same model applies to memory daily notes.
- **`rules/drift-control.mdc` — adds a "Trust model" section.** Codifies the derivation of `trust` and `quarantine` from `provenance` and `[external]` flags, and the user-only contract for clearing quarantines.
- **`rules/memory.mdc` — `[external]` content lands quarantined.** When a memory candidate carrying `[external]` is promoted, it lands with `trust: low`, `quarantine: true`, `quarantine_reason: external-source` and stays there until the user explicitly clears it.
- **`skills/memory-distill/SKILL.md` — stamps every promotion** with `provenance`, `trust`, `quarantine`, `quarantine_reason` (when applicable), and `last_referenced` per the contract. Also encodes the earn-the-folder procedure end to end.
- **`skills/drift-scan/SKILL.md` — five-layer model.** Adds memory layer to the inventory (daily notes, earned memory subfolders, commitments, parsed bullet domain tags). Computes freshness per entry. Mode flags renumbered (shallow = layers 1–4, deep includes layer 5).
- **`skills/kb-search/SKILL.md` — surfaces trust + freshness + quarantine.** Output table now includes Trust and Freshness columns; quarantined entries get a `⚠ quarantined (<reason>)` flag and are deprioritized in scoring.
- **`skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md` — health table extended.** Reports KB trust distribution (`high / medium / low / quarantined`), KB freshness distribution (`fresh / aging / stale`), earn-the-folder candidates, and adds an "Analyze KB trust + freshness" step (4b) that surfaces quarantined and stale entries.
- **`skills/knowledge-base/SKILL.md` — authoring writes the new fields.** Frontmatter checklist now includes `last_referenced`, `provenance`, `trust`, `quarantine`. Updating section adds a `last_referenced` bump rule (deliberate re-validation, not casual reads) and the user-only quarantine-clearing contract.
- **`seed-sources/memory/_index.md` — explains the earn-the-folder trigger** and how routing changes after promotion.

### Migration from 0.2.x

`/init-harness` is idempotent. Re-running on a v0.2.x project upgrades the `v=0.2.0` / `v=0.2.1` primer / gitignore blocks in place to `v=0.3.0`. **Existing KB entries do not gain the new frontmatter fields automatically** — they're additive at the schema-template level. Existing entries continue to work; fields are read with sensible defaults:

- Missing `last_referenced` → falls back to `updated`.
- Missing `provenance` → treated as `direct`.
- Missing `trust` → treated as `medium`.
- Missing `quarantine` → treated as `false`.

When you next edit an existing entry, add the four fields. `harness-audit` will surface entries missing them as a low-severity advisory.

### Deferred

- **Auto-bump `last_referenced` when an entry is cited in a chat** — currently bumped only by deliberate skill action. Lands in `0.4.0` once Cursor exposes a hook for tool-result citation events.
- **`pre-compact` hook.** Still relies on agent discipline rather than a Cursor-side automation.
- **`--migrate=copy|subtree|submodule|none`** for code-at-root.
- **Atomic rollback on partial failure.**
- **Comprehensive refusal exit codes.**

## 0.2.1 — 2026-05-04

Tracks `harness@0.2.1`. Clarifying patch on top of 0.2.0 — sharpens the conceptual relationship between the new memory layer and the existing `fieldnote` KB schema, so the agent doesn't blur them.

### Changed

- **`rules/memory.mdc` — adds a "Memory vs. fieldnotes" section.** Frames the five KB schemas: `concept` / `decision` / `policy` / `specification` are declarative (atemporal); `fieldnote` is the only **episodic** schema and the curated subset of memory that earned promotion. Memory is the raw form, fieldnotes are the curated form. Memory and fieldnotes are stages of the same pipeline, not parallel mechanisms — and a fieldnote without a memory phase, or a memory entry without a fieldnote, are both fine by design.
- **`rules/knowledge-base.mdc` — Fieldnotes section reframed.** Notes that fieldnote is the only non-atemporal schema, and that most fieldnotes originate from `[lesson-candidate]` entries via `memory-distill` (with direct authoring fine when the lesson is already crisp). Cross-links to the new memory rule.
- **Re-runs of `/init-harness` upgrade the v=0.2.0 primer / gitignore blocks in place to v=0.2.1.** No new files, no new behavior — just the clarifying frame.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-04

Tracks `harness@0.2.0`. Adds the **memory** component — the agent's running-state layer of the harness — and promotes the operating model from four components to five.

### Added

- **5th component: `memory/`** (git-tracked) — agent-writable short-term lane sister to `.cursor/`. Holds `daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` running notes, `commitments.md` for short-lived dated follow-ups, and `distillations/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` audit trail of consolidation runs. Seeded by `/init-harness` with an `_index.md`, an empty `daily/`, an empty `distillations/`, and a templated `commitments.md`.
- **New rule: `memory.mdc`** — codifies the capture lane (`[observation]` / `[lesson-candidate]` / `[decision-candidate]` / `[concept-candidate]` / `[commitment]` tags), session lifecycle (kb-search at start, append signals during, flush before `/compact`), retention model (30-day active window), trust model (memory is agent-suggested; promotion to KB requires user approval), and anti-patterns. Brings the harness's rule count to **8**.
- **New skill: `kb-search`** — disciplined filesystem search over `knowledge/<domain>/` with index-first walking, optional body grep fallback, supersede-chain unwinding, and active-policy conflict surfacing. Also walks the last 7 days of `memory/daily/` so unflushed signals enter task context. **Mandatory pre-task gate** per the harness contract: `harness.mdc` "Read first" now requires `kb-search` before any substantive work.
- **New skill: `memory-distill`** — consolidation pump that walks `memory/daily/` and `memory/commitments.md`, scores candidates with weighted recency (14-day half-life), cross-checks the KB and registry via `kb-search`, and produces a proposal list of promotions, conflict surfaces, structural moves (earn `memory/<domain>/`), and prunes. Proposal-only — never auto-applies; user approves; promoted candidates are handed to `knowledge-base`. Logs every run to `memory/distillations/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (append-only audit trail). Brings the framework-skill count to **7**.
- **New slash command: `/distill`** — invokes `memory-distill`.
- **Five-layer drift model** — `drift-control.mdc` now covers Registry, Knowledge, Memory, Scaffolding, Codebase with new memory-specific drift signals (lesson-candidate recurring without fieldnote, decision-candidate older than 14 days, memory contradicting active policy, commitments past due, daily note older than 30 days never distilled, etc.).
- **`harness-audit` extension** — now calls `memory-distill` as a step and reports a Memory hygiene section (daily-note count vs. retention, undistilled signals, commitment backlog, oldest unprocessed daily note, `[external]` entries awaiting review). Audit proposals can include memory-side actions (promote `memory/<domain>/`, prune stale daily notes, surface poisoning candidates).

### Changed

- **`harness.mdc` — five-component model.** The four-component table is replaced by a two-layer / five-component table: project layer (`knowledge/`, `workspace/`, `codebase/`) and harness layer (`memory/`, `.cursor/`). The "Read first" section is promoted from advisory to **mandatory** and now includes a hard `kb-search` step plus a memory-scan step. Skipping `kb-search` is explicitly listed as a contract violation.
- **`knowledge-base.mdc` — `kb-search` is the canonical Read step.** Reading `_index.md` directly is no longer sufficient — `kb-search` is the contract. Fieldnote section now describes promotion via `memory-distill` rather than direct authoring during a session.
- **`subagents.mdc` — domain agents inherit memory access.** Read filtered today/yesterday daily notes for their domain, write entries tagged with their own domain to today's daily note. May not edit other domains' entries, older daily notes, or write directly to `knowledge/`. `kb-search` is still mandatory for them.
- **`domains.mdc` — `memory/<domain>/` follows the same "earn the folder" rule.** Until earned, daily notes stay flat with inline domain tags. `memory-distill` proposes folder promotions when the threshold is met.
- **`AGENTS.primer.md` — five components, mandatory `kb-search`.** First-use checklist updated to include `/distill`. Default-behavior list updated for the new capture lane and pre-compact flush convention.
- **In-place upgrade flow for stale markers** (`init-harness` hook). The v0.1.0 deferred upgrade flow now lands: when `AGENTS.md` or `.gitignore` carry harness markers from a prior version, the hook **replaces the block contents in place** while preserving everything outside the markers verbatim. Plan output reports `modify` instead of skipping. Tested for content preservation before and after both blocks.

### Migration from 0.1.0

`/init-harness` is idempotent. Re-run it on an existing v0.1.0 project:

- The stale `<!-- harness:primer:start v=0.1.0 -->` block in `AGENTS.md` is upgraded in place to v=0.2.0 — your content above and below is preserved.
- The stale `# harness:gitignore:start v=0.1.0` block in `.gitignore` is upgraded similarly.
- The new `memory/` directory is seeded (no overwrites if files already exist there).
- All other files are untouched.

`workspace/` semantics are unchanged. Memory has nothing to do with workspace — they are different components in the new five-component model.

### Deferred

- **`pre-compact` hook.** The compaction-safety contract in `memory.mdc` documents the flush-before-compact behavior; an explicit Cursor hook landing in `0.3.0` (pending Cursor's hook surface for compaction events).
- **Automatic recency-weighted KB-entry "freshness" advisory** in drift-scan. The 14-day half-life model is implemented in `memory-distill` for memory candidates; extending it to active KB entries (replacing the binary "180-day stale" advisory) lands in `0.3.0`.
- **Trust scoring on promoted KB entries.** `[external]` flag handling exists in `memory-distill`; richer trust scoring on the resulting KB entry (audit gate, never-reviewed-quarantine) lands in `0.3.0`.
- **`--migrate=copy|subtree|submodule|none`** for code-at-root. Still notice-only.
- **Atomic rollback on partial failure.** Still best-effort.
- **Comprehensive refusal exit codes** (`10` / `20` / `30` / `40` / `50`) per `bundles/INIT-SPEC.md`. Still `0` / `1` only.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-02

Initial release. Tracks `harness@0.1.0`.

### Added

- 7 agent-requestable rules: `harness`, `domains`, `knowledge-base`, `skills-organization`, `scaffolding`, `drift-control`, `subagents`. All shipped with `alwaysApply: false` (plugin-shipped rules get demoted regardless).
- 5 framework skills: `domain-registry`, `knowledge-base`, `drift-scan`, `scaffolding-author`, `harness-audit`. Authored flat under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` so Cursor's default discovery finds them.
- 4 templates: `service-skill.md`, `domain-skill.md`, `task-skill.md`, `domain-agent.md` — seeded into `<project>/.cursor/skills/_templates/`.
- 4 slash commands: `init-harness`, `audit`, `drift-scan`, `kb-add`.
- `/init-harness` hook with marker-aware AGENTS.md prepend and `.gitignore` append; skip-if-exists for `knowledge/`, `workspace/`, `codebase/`, and `.cursor/skills/{_templates,services}/` seed files.
- Project seed payload: `AGENTS.primer.md` block, `gitignore.harness` block, `knowledge/_meta/` skeleton (registry, glossary, subdomain catalogue, five schemas), `workspace/{.gitkeep,README.md}`, `codebase/README.md`, `.cursor/skills/{_templates,services}/`.
- Build pipeline: `scripts/build.ts` produces only `seeds/` (a runtime copy of `seed-sources/`). Rules, skills, commands, and hooks are plugin-authored and committed — all framework content lives inside the plugin folder.
- Local-install pipeline: `scripts/install-local.ts` and `scripts/uninstall-local.ts` copy the plugin into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/magik-repo/`. Cursor 0.x does not follow symlinks at that path ([cursor/plugins#35](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/issues/35)), so the install is a real directory copy refreshed on each `pnpm install-local`.
- Test suite (`node:test`): empty-project full-seed, AGENTS.md prepend with content preservation, idempotency, and `--dry-run` no-write behavior.

### Deferred

- **Marker upgrade flow.** v0.1.0 detects existing harness markers and refuses with "already harnessed at v=…"; replacing the block contents in place lands in `0.2.0`.
- **`--migrate=copy|subtree|submodule|none`.** v0.1.0 detects code at the repo root and prints a plan-time notice; it does not refuse the apply phase.
- **Atomic rollback on partial failure.** v0.1.0 writes are best-effort; a mid-apply error leaves the project in an in-between state.
- **Comprehensive refusal exit codes.** v0.1.0 only emits `0` (success / no-op) and `1` (any error). The richer codes (`10` / `20` / `30` / `40` / `50`) per `bundles/INIT-SPEC.md` arrive in `0.2.0`.
- **Plan-output format parity.** v0.1.0 uses a simplified plan format; the canonical format from the spec lands alongside the upgrade flow.
