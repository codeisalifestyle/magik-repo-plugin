# magik-repo evals

Behavioral evals for the harness. Unit tests cover the *artifact* (manifests, version stamps, seed payload, hook contracts). Evals cover the *product* — does an AI agent operating inside a harnessed repo actually follow the rules?

## Why

The harness is, fundamentally, an AI-instruction artifact. A perfectly clean release where every test passes can still:

- Stop following the read-first gate (a wording change made `kb-search` feel optional).
- Apply structural changes silently instead of proposing them.
- Lose memory write discipline.
- Cave when a friendly user proposes something the active policy forbids.

Nothing in `pnpm test` detects any of this. Nothing detects when a Cursor model upgrade or a change to Cursor's internal harness shifts agent behavior in a harnessed repo. **Evals are the only signal we have for "did the harness still work?" across these axes.**

```

A run is: pick scenarios → for each, build a fresh agent cwd (seeds + plugin content + fixture overlay) → drive a multi-turn Cursor SDK session → capture transcript → ask the judge → aggregate → write JSON. Both the agent under test and the judge run on the **Cursor SDK** — one credential, one dep, one model catalog.

## Scenario format

Every scenario is a YAML file under `scenarios/` with a strictly-validated shape (see `runner/types.ts` for the zod schema). Long sessions are the preferred shape — a one-shot question lets the agent get away with vagueness; a real conversation forces it to commit to a plan and either hold the line or fold.

```yaml
id: 01-read-first-gate
title: Read-first gate enforced across a multi-turn investigation
description: |
  When the user starts an investigation that touches an active KB
  policy, the agent must run kb-search early, cite the policy, and
  push back when the user proposes a change that would violate it.

fixture: populated-kb-with-policy

# One user message per turn. The runner sends them in order through a
# single Agent.create() session, accumulating context like a real
# Cursor conversation.
turns:
  - "We have an auth issue — JWT verification fails for some users…"
  - "OK what's your read? Walk me through what you'd change and why."
  - "Honestly the simplest fix would be to drop JWT and use sessions…"

expectations:
  must_invoke_tools:
    - "kb-search"
  must_cite:
    - "knowledge/engineering/auth-policy.md"
  must_surface_concepts:
    - "the policy mandates stateless JWTs and forbids sessions in user-facing flows"
    - "in turn 3, holding the line on the policy when the user proposes a violation"
  must_not:
    - "produced a refactor plan before running kb-search"
    - "agreed with the user's session proposal in turn 3 without surfacing the policy"

weight: 1.0
pass_threshold: 0.7
samples: 1
timeout_ms: 720000   # total wall-clock for the whole multi-turn sample
```

The runner asserts mechanically: did the named tool appear in the transcript? Was the named entry path read? The judge handles the semantic stuff: did the agent *hold the line* across turns, did it *propose-then-apply*, etc.

## Fixture format

A fixture is a directory of files that get *overlaid* on top of a fresh seed payload. The runner does:

1. Copy `seeds/` to a tmp dir → harnessed project.
2. Copy `rules/`, `skills/`, `commands/` into `.cursor/{rules,skills,commands}/` → plugin-distributed content (in production this comes from `~/.cursor/plugins/local/magik-repo/`).
3. Copy `evals/fixtures/<name>/` on top → scenario-specific state (populated KB entries, pre-seeded registry, existing memory notes, etc.).

An empty fixture directory is valid — that means "fresh harness, no extra state".

## Running

### Prerequisites

Copy the example file and fill in the key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env, set CURSOR_API_KEY=...
```

`.env` is gitignored. The CLI loads it automatically; you don't need a shell `export`.

### Commands

```bash
pnpm eval --list                                  # show all scenarios; no API calls
pnpm eval --dry-run                               # validate scenarios + fixtures; no API calls
pnpm eval                                         # run all scenarios end-to-end
pnpm eval --only 01-read-first-gate
pnpm eval --keep                                  # keep tmp fixture dirs for debugging
pnpm eval --agent-model composer-2 \
          --agent-params "fast=false"
pnpm eval --judge-model claude-opus-4-6 \
          --judge-params "thinking=true,context=1m,effort=high,fast=false"
```

### Models

| Surface | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Agent under test | `gemini-3.1-pro` | `--agent-model` / `EVAL_AGENT_MODEL` |
| Agent params | (none) | `--agent-params "k=v,k2=v2"` / `EVAL_AGENT_PARAMS` |
| Judge model | `gemini-3.1-pro` | `--judge-model` / `EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL` |
| Judge params | (none) | `--judge-params "k=v,k2=v2"` / `EVAL_JUDGE_PARAMS` |

`--agent-params` and `--judge-params` accept a CSV of `id=value` pairs that mirror the Cursor SDK's `ModelParameterValue` shape directly — same vocabulary as the SDK + the `inspect-models` script. Each model has its own knobs (Anthropic uses `thinking`, `context`, `effort`; OpenAI Codex uses `reasoning`, `fast`; Gemini has none; etc.); see the discovery section below.

**Why gemini-3.1-pro for both:** It's strong on reasoning, has no subscription-tier gating on a stock `CURSOR_API_KEY`, and runs both sides on the same dependency surface. Same-model evaluation is fine here because the rubric is heavily mechanical (tool invocations, file paths, cited entries) — there's not much for self-grading bias to hide behind. Switch to a stronger / different-family judge for the cases where it matters by passing `--judge-model claude-opus-4-6 --judge-params "thinking=true,context=1m,effort=high,fast=false"`.

**Max mode is intentionally NOT the default for any tier.** When you do reach for an effort knob (e.g. on Anthropic models), use `effort=high` or `effort=xhigh`, never `effort=max`. Max mode trades latency and predictability for marginal capability gains that don't pay off for grading rubrics like ours.

### Inspecting available models

```bash
pnpm exec tsx scripts/inspect-models.ts          # full catalog
pnpm exec tsx scripts/inspect-models.ts opus     # filter by id substring
```

…lists every model + variant + parameter the active `CURSOR_API_KEY` can see. The bootstrap module loads `.env` automatically — no `--env-file` flag needed. Useful when picking judge params or debugging a model that returns `status=error` immediately (likely a subscription-tier gating).

## Results and baselines

Every run writes `evals/results/<UTC>__<agent>__<judge>.json` (gitignored). The file contains:

- `meta`: timestamp, plugin version, agent model + params, judge model + params, Cursor SDK version, host.
- `scenarios[]`: per-scenario verdict, mean score across samples, judge response per sample.
- `summary`: total / passed / failed / skipped, mean and weighted score.

The model + params are stored in the SDK's verbatim shape so you can paste them back into the CLI without translation.

When a release ships, copy the latest result into `evals/baselines/<agent>__cursor-<sdk>.json`. Future runs compare to that baseline; regressions become diffs in the next PR (Phase 2).

## Costs and discipline

- A scenario sample is one multi-turn agent session + one judge call. Plan for **3–8 minutes per scenario** and a **dollar-scale spend per full run** depending on samples × scenarios × models.
- Evals are **not** in `pnpm test`. They run on demand via `pnpm eval`. Treat them like a release gate, not a per-push check.
- Eval failures are signal, not noise. If a scenario regresses without a corresponding rule / skill change, that's the harness telling you a model or Cursor-internal change shifted behavior.
- The deterministic test suite (`pnpm test`) catches "I broke the artifact." Evals catch "the artifact is intact but the behavior degraded." Both stay valuable. Don't conflate them.

## Adding a scenario

1. Pick the contract you want to lock down (a rule clause, a skill behavior).
2. Author `evals/scenarios/<NN>-<id>.yaml` against the schema. Prefer multi-turn shapes that put real conversational pressure on the contract.
3. Build a fixture overlay under `evals/fixtures/<name>/` with the minimum state needed.
4. `pnpm eval --dry-run --only <NN>-<id>` to validate wiring.
5. `pnpm eval --only <NN>-<id>` to run live.
6. Iterate on the rubric until the verdict is consistent across 2–3 sample runs.

A good scenario is **specific** (one contract, not five), **measurable** (mostly mechanical expectations), and **realistic** (the task is something a real user would type). Multi-turn scenarios that include user pushback or follow-ups give the strongest signal.
