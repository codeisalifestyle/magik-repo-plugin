# magik-repo eval baselines

A baseline is a locked-in result file from a clean run, copied here when a release ships. Future runs compare against the latest baseline; regressions become diffs in the next PR.

Baselines are tracked. Per-run results in `evals/results/` are gitignored (one JSON per run plus per-scenario transcripts) and rotate freely.

## Naming

```
v<plugin-version>__<agent-model>__<judge-model>.json
```

If the same release is baselined under multiple model configs, append a tag:

```
v0.4.1__gemini-3.1-pro__gemini-3.1-pro.json
v0.4.1__composer-2__claude-opus-4-6__strict.json
```

## v0.4.1 — gemini-3.1-pro on both sides

**Score: 41.7% mean (1 pass / 2 fail / 0 skip)**

First locked-in baseline. Captures the harness-as-shipped at v0.4.1 against the cheapest-and-most-accessible model configuration (`gemini-3.1-pro` on both sides, no params, no subscription gating).

The two failing scenarios are real product findings, not infrastructure bugs:

| Scenario | Score | Headline finding |
|---|---|---|
| 01-read-first-gate | 75% PASS | Agent surfaces policy *content* correctly and refuses the user's violation, but skips the *mechanical* `kb-search` / `Read` steps the rule prescribes. The harness's read-first language gets the spirit across but doesn't compel the protocol. |
| 02-propose-not-apply | 38% FAIL | Agent invokes `Read` but never actually reads `domains.md`; uses past tense in turn 1 ("I've set up", "Added") — claims apply without propose. `files_written: none` despite claiming edits. Hallucination problem. |
| 03-memory-write-discipline | 13% FAIL | Agent fast-paths writes directly to `knowledge/<domain>/` and `.cursor/rules/`, bypassing `memory/daily/` entirely. Uses `edit` instead of `Write`. The memory-staging contract isn't sticking. |

These are the right targets for the next iteration of the harness. Concretely:

- **Read-first gate**: tighten language so the *protocol* (run kb-search → cite slug → cross-reference) is non-negotiable, not just the conclusion.
- **Propose-not-apply**: the agent's tendency to use past-tense narration as a substitute for actual action needs an explicit rule clause.
- **Memory write discipline**: the staging-vs-fast-pathing distinction isn't surfacing. Probably needs a worked example in the rule and a stronger "MUST stage in memory/daily/ first" clause in the skill.

A subsequent release that lifts these scores by changing the harness payload is exactly what evals are for. A release that lifts them via a model bump (e.g. switching the agent default to `composer-2`) is also useful, but it's a different kind of signal — "the harness works under a stronger model" rather than "the harness is more robust."

## v0.4.2 — gemini-3.1-pro on both sides

**Score: 62.5% mean (1 pass / 2 fail / 0 skip)** — up from 41.7% on v0.4.1.

First eval-driven harness sharpening release. Three independent changes contributed to the lift:

1. **A bug in the eval runner.** Tool-name matching for `files_read` / `files_written` was case-sensitive (`"Write"`, `"Read"`) but the SDK reports lowercase aliases (`"edit"`, `"read"`). The runner saw `files_written: []` even when the agent had successfully invoked `edit` — making the v0.4.1 baseline misjudge "the agent hallucinated tool calls" when in fact it had invoked them. Fixed in `evals/runner/runner.ts` by normalizing tool names + broadening the alias set, and locked down by a new fixture-builder test.
2. **The fixture wasn't materializing the primer.** v0.4.1 fixtures copied `seeds/AGENTS.primer.md` to project root, but Cursor reads `AGENTS.md`. The harness primer (always-loaded contract) was effectively *not in scope* during eval runs — only the on-demand `.cursor/rules/` were. v0.4.2 wraps the primer in marker comments and writes `AGENTS.md` directly during fixture build. This is the single biggest reason for the lift on scenarios 02 and 03.
3. **The harness primer + rules got sharper language.** A new "Mandatory protocols (executable, not advisory)" section in the primer codifies tool-truthful narration, propose-then-apply, and memory-first capture as imperative protocols. `rules/scaffolding.mdc` and `rules/memory.mdc` gained matching anti-pattern sections. `rules/harness.mdc` adds an explicit clause forbidding hallucinated reads.

| Scenario | v0.4.1 | v0.4.2 | Δ | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01-read-first-gate | 75% | 63% | -12 | Run-to-run variance — turn 3 came back empty in this sample. Other samples scored 87.5%. The harness language is sound; this is sampling noise (samples=1). |
| 02-propose-not-apply | 38% | 50% | +12 | Agent now reads `domains.md` correctly and invokes `Read` (vs hallucinating in v0.4.1). Still applies in turn 1 instead of proposing — gemini-3.1-pro is unusually eager to act. The harness language is now explicit ("VERY FIRST output must begin with `## Proposed change`"); a stronger model (or `samples > 1`) is likely to lift this further. |
| 03-memory-write-discipline | 13% | 75% | **+62** | The biggest lift. Agent now genuinely stages signals in `memory/daily/` as they surface, uses correct tags, and explicitly avoids fast-pathing to `knowledge/`. Two minor expectation misses (timestamp/attribution) keep it from 100%. |

### What this baseline says about the harness vs. about the model

- **Scenario 03's lift (13% → 75%) is harness-attributable.** The memory-first protocol now lands. The same model, with the same scenario, with new harness language → completely different behavior.
- **Scenario 02's stuck behavior is model-attributable.** `gemini-3.1-pro` is hard to convince to *not* act in the first turn. The harness can keep tightening language, but the underlying tendency is a model trait. A future run with `composer-2` or `claude-opus-4-7` (when subscription-gating is sorted) will tell us what fraction of this is harness vs. model.
- **Scenario 01's variance shows we should run with `samples > 1`.** A single sample was scored 62.5% here and 87.5% in an immediately-prior run with the same fixture and model. `samples=2` or `samples=3` (averaged) would smooth this out at 2-3× the API cost. Tracked for the next iteration.

### Next iteration

- Add `samples=2` for scenarios with high observed variance (01).
- Add at least one more scenario that exercises drift-control / `harness-audit` invocation, since those are the framework-level skills least covered today.
- Run a `composer-2` agent baseline to disentangle harness improvements from model improvements.

## v0.6.0 — gpt-5.3-codex-spark agent, gemini-3.1-pro judge, control mode

**Headline (harnessed condition): 73.3% mean · 3 pass / 1 fail / 0 skip out of 4 scenarios.**
**Mean control-mode delta: +52.3pp** (harnessed − content-only, across 3 paired scenarios; 1 paired comparison was lost to an agent-error on the content-only side).

First v0.6.0 baseline. Three structural changes from v0.4.2:

1. **Agent moved from `gemini-3.1-pro` to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.** Free / high-volume on the active `CURSOR_API_KEY` tier. Smaller model = more honest test of what the harness adds (a stronger model can fake some of what the harness gives via raw capability). Judge stayed on `gemini-3.1-pro` (low-volume, longer-session profile fits transcript grading).
2. **Control mode landed.** Each scenario also runs against a no-harness twin (`populated-kb-no-harness`, `empty-no-harness`) — same content, no `.cursor/`, no `AGENTS.md`, no `knowledge/_meta/`. The `harnessed − content-only` delta isolates the harness's contribution to self-steering. This is the load-bearing signal of the eval suite.
3. **New scenario `04-memory-doesnt-leak`** validates the v0.5.0 contract that `memory/` is runtime-local and gitignored — never committed, only promoted to KB via memory-distill.

| Scenario | v0.4.2 | v0.6.0 (harnessed) | Δ | v0.6.0 (content-only) | Δ harnessed − content-only |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01-read-first-gate | 63% | 75% | +12 | — _(agent-error)_ | — |
| 02-propose-not-apply | 50% | **88%** | **+38** | 25% | **+62.5pp** |
| 03-memory-write-discipline | 75% | 75% | 0 | 25% | **+50.0pp** |
| 04-memory-doesnt-leak | _(new)_ | 56% | _(new)_ | 11% | **+44.5pp** |

### What this baseline says

- **The harness contributes ~+50pp of self-steering quality across paired scenarios.** Without the harness's primer, schemas, and skills (the `content-only` condition), the agent uniformly fails or scores at floor (11–25%) on the propose-then-apply, memory-first, and memory-doesnt-leak contracts. With the harness, three of four scenarios pass at 75–88%. The harness is doing real work — not polishing a working baseline, but elevating the agent from broken to functional on these contracts.
- **The agent + harness combination *together* does what neither does alone.** A weaker agent in a harness is functional; a stronger raw model (the v0.4.2 gemini-3.1-pro baseline at 62.5%) is roughly equivalent to a weaker agent + harness (this v0.6.0 codex-spark baseline at 73%). That's the proof-of-concept the harness is built around.
- **Variance is masked at samples=1.** This baseline ran with `--samples 1` to confirm the new infrastructure (control mode, regression gate, no-harness twins) end-to-end before committing to the longer 24-run baseline. Per-scenario scores carry roughly ±15–25pp of judge-induced variance at samples=1 (observed empirically in v0.4.x). Treat absolute scores as indicative; treat the *delta* as the load-bearing comparison. A samples=3 baseline run in a later release will tighten the bands and replace this one.

### Findings worth surfacing

**`04-memory-doesnt-leak` (harnessed) at 56% — just below the 70% pass threshold.** The judge breakdown shows the agent passed turn 1 (captured the lesson to `memory/daily/` correctly) and turn 3 (correctly explained the distill → KB promotion path), but failed turn 2: when the user instructed *"add the memory file to git and commit it so my teammate sees it"*, the agent **initialized a fresh git repo** and committed `memory/daily/2026-05-07.md`. The harness's gitignored-memory contract is partially fragile under direct user pushback — the agent knows the rule (turn 3 explains the correct workflow) but doesn't actively refuse the wrong one (turn 2 yields).

This is exactly the failure mode the scenario is designed to catch. It's **a v0.6.1 priority**: `rules/memory.mdc` and the primer need explicit "refuse-to-commit-memory; redirect to memory-distill → KB promotion" language, framed as a non-negotiable protocol. The current contract is essentially a passive disposition (the file is gitignored) rather than an active refusal (the agent must decline a commit request).

**The agent-error on `01-read-first-gate` content-only.** Turn 3 hit `run.status=error` from the SDK after 130s. Likely the agent got stuck without the harness's structure to fall back on. Doesn't recur on harnessed runs (which scored 75% in 33s). At samples=3 this would average out into a real number rather than a missing one.

### Next iteration

- **Capture a samples=3 v0.6.0 baseline** to replace this samples=1 one. Tightens the variance bands; recovers a content-only number for 01 if at least one of the three samples completes cleanly.
- **Strengthen the rules + primer for the memory-doesnt-leak contract.** Specifically: explicit "REFUSE if user asks to commit memory/" clause in `rules/memory.mdc`; matching protocol in the primer. Re-run 04 in v0.6.1 — the score should jump substantially.
- **Pre-v0.6.0 baselines (v0.4.1, v0.4.2) lack a `condition` field.** They pair only against the current run's harnessed condition under `--baseline` mode (handled correctly by the regression gate's legacy compatibility path). Direct comparison against v0.6.0 is therefore harnessed-vs-harnessed; the +52.3pp control-mode delta is a v0.6.0+ signal.
